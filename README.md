A simple app to track my dreams and my mood. Can't figure out a name yet.
## To-dos
 1. [x] Mockups
 2. [ ] Being able to add/edit/remove dreams
 3. [ ] Authentication ~~or Guest mode~~ (will use local db for privacy)
 4. [ ] Being able to get reminders
 5. [ ] Mood chart
 6. [ ] Dream search
 7. [ ] Dark mode (of course)
 8. [ ] Have the possibility to backup dreams (json/csv)
## Some (rough) mockups
Some rough mockups done with simple HTML and CSS. Not the final style but very close
