A simple app to track my dreams and my mood. Can't figure out a name yet.

## To-dos

- [x] Mockups
- [ ] Being able to add/edit/remove dreams
- [ ] Authentication ~~or Guest mode~~ (will use local db for privacy)
- [ ] Being able to get reminders
- [ ] Mood chart
- [ ] Dream search
- [ ] Dark mode (of course)
- [ ] Have the possibility to backup the dreams (json/csv)
