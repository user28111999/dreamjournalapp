# ???
A simple app for myself to track my dreams, my mood and remind me to take my pills. Can't figure out a name yet.
## To-dos
 - [x] Mockups
 - [x] Being able to add/edit/remove dreams
 - [x] Dream search
 - [ ] Dark mode (of course)
 - [ ] Have the possibility to backup dreams (json/csv)
## Some (rough) mockups
Some rough mockups done with simple HTML and CSS. Not the final style but very close
